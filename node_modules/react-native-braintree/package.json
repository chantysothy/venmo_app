Register a URL scheme in Xcode (should always start with your Bundle ID)\n  ![Register URL Scheme](/Screenshots/urlscheme.png)\n\n2. Use setupWithURLScheme instead, passing the url scheme you have registered in previous step\n  ```js\n  var BTClient = require('react-native-braintree');\n  BTClient.setupWithURLScheme(<token>, <url scheme>);\n  ```\n\n3. Add this delegate method (callback) to your AppDelegate.m\n  ```objc\n  #import <RNBraintree.h>\n\n  - (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application openURL:(NSURL *)url sourceApplication:(NSString *)sourceApplication annotation:(id)annotation {\n    return [[RNBraintree sharedInstance] application:application openURL:url sourceApplication:sourceApplication annotation:annotation];\n  }\n  ```\n\n4. Optionally, install the [fake PayPal wallet app](https://github.com/braintree/fake-wallet-app-ios) in your simulator to simulate and test responses\n\n## Installation\n1. `react-native init BTRNSample` (skip for existing projects)\n2. Run `npm install react-native-braintree --save` to add the package\n3. Inside the ``ios/`` directory, create a Podfile:\n\n  ```ruby\n  # Podfile for cocoapods 1.0\n  source 'https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs.git'\n  target 'yourAppTarget' do\n    pod 'React', :path => '../node_modules/react-native', :subspecs => [\n      'Core',\n      'RCTImage',\n      'RCTNetwork',\n      'RCTText',\n      'RCTWebSocket'\n    ]\n    pod 'react-native-braintree', :path => '../node_modules/react-native-braintree'\n  end\n  ```\n\n  Or if you use an older CocoaPods version:\n  ```ruby\n  source 'https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs.git'\n  pod 'React', :path => '../node_modules/react-native', :subspecs => [\n    'Core',\n    'RCTImage',\n    'RCTNetwork',\n    'RCTText',\n    'RCTWebSocket'\n  ]\n  pod 'react-native-braintree', :path => '../node_modules/react-native-braintree'\n  ```\n\n4. Run `pod install`.  This installs the Braintree iOS SDK and a new workspace is created.\n\n5. Open `BTRNSample.xcworkspace`\n\n6. Under your app target -> build settings, look for `Other Linker Flags` and add `$(inherited)`\n\n  ![Accepts Credit/Debit Cards](/Screenshots/linker.png)\n\n7. Build and run project!  If it fails the first time, clean and rebuild.\n\nBecause React Native's iOS code is now pulled in via CocoaPods, you also need to remove the ``React``, ``RCTImage``, etc. subprojects from your app's Xcode project.\n\n![Remove Libraries](/Screenshots/removeLibraries.png)\n\n\n## Requirements\n\nTested with:\n* Node 4.1.0\n* npm 2.14.3\n* react-native 0.8.0\n\n## License\n\nreact-native-braintree is available under the MIT license. See the LICENSE file for more info.\n",
